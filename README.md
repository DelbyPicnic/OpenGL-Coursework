###Computer graphics module coursework for SET08116.
___
##About:
This project is written in C++ and OpenGL as part of my Computer Graphics module (set08116)
Coursework specification requires me to produce a 3D scene rendered in realtime using OpenGL. The final product must maintain 60 frames-per-second. My goal performance however is stable 60-120FPS at 1080P or 1440P, which should be easily achieved using a moderately powerful GPU.

##Design:
As a lover of music in general, I have a fascination with sound visualization on computers and old Hi-Fi systems. I have previously written software that visualizes audio (.wav) files using LEDs on a Raspberry Pi 2 development board, additionally in a 3D environment using Unity 3D, therefore I have decided to focus my Graphics project around audio visualization.

For general set design I have taken the new Imagine Dragons single 'Believer' Cover as my inspiration. This art piece illustrates a 3D set with numerous shapes, light sources, and textures, combining to produce an 80s Retro SciFi style setting - another of my interests.

This choice in set design proposes several technical hurdles; screenspace reflections, volumetric fog and area lighting sources. Implementing these technologies using OpenGL & C++ without the aid of a 3D engine will be my primary challenge.
