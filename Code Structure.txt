Code Structure Note for OpenGL Coursework
*****************************************************

Each 3D model should have it's own geometry object
Each geometry object should be provided with the position and colour data for each vertice.
Each geometry object should have an "Add Buffer" call for colour and position data.

Every model in my project will be created by providing and manipulating vertice data that is
coded in the application rather than loading in models as .OBJ files. This is for simplicity
of creating and modifying the scene in accordance with music in the final version.


*****************************************************

The camera should be in a fixed position in the 3D scene but should sway and nudge according to
the  music data. 
i.e on a significant low frequency burst such as a bass or drum hit, the camera should sway to 
the side slightly. This action shouuld be padded and not an instantaneous action to add to the
realism of a camera sway.
